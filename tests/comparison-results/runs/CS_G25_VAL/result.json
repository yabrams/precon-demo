The primary project risk stems from unknown existing conditions inherent in a re-roofing project, specifically the potential for deteriorated roof decking and wet insulation, which could lead to significant change orders. A secondary risk is the lack of structural details for the new RTU curbs, which requires an RFI for accurate pricing. The project also features two additive alternates that require careful scope delineation across trades to avoid bidding errors. Coordination between roofing, MEP, and civil trades is critical to project success."
