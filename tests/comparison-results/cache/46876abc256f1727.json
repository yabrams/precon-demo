The highest risk is the potential to miss the 5/8\" recovery board scope addition from Addendum No. 2, which is essential for the warranty. Significant coordination is required for the rooftop equipment replacement and the major electrical system modifications. The simplification of the HVAC controls scope is a key cost-related clarification that has been correctly identified. A manual quantity take-off and a site visit to verify existing electrical conditions are strongly recommended."
