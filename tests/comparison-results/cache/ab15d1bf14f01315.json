        "summary": "The extraction provides a comprehensive overview of the Kenai Rec Center Upgrades project, covering all major trades. Data quality is high, with most items traced to specific drawings or specifications. The project's risk level is HIGH, primarily due to a critical scope addition (roof recovery board) located in an addendum, which could be easily missed. Significant coordination is required for rooftop equipment replacement, and major electrical upgrades in an occupied facility present further risk. Bidders must thoroughly review all addenda and conduct detailed site investigations to mitigate these risks."
