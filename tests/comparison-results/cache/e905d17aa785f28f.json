While it successfully identified and detailed several key packages (Demolition, Civil, Roofing, RTUs), it completely missed the entire new electrical distribution, gas piping, controls, TAB, and commissioning scopes. Furthermore, it failed to incorporate critical, cost-impacting changes from the project addenda, such as the requirement for a roofing recovery board and the simplification of the controls system. The data that was extracted contained minor inaccuracies and showed confusion with inconsistent terminology across disciplines. The missing scopes and addenda items introduce significant financial and execution risk. The extraction requires major additions and corrections to be considered usable."
