The critical review identified these gaps and, most importantly, highlighted the major risks associated with the addenda, particularly the addition of the recovery board (Addendum 2) and the electrical impact of substituted HVAC equipment (Addendum 1). The project's risk level is medium, driven by the occupied renovation status, stringent warranty requirements, and the potential for unforeseen conditions in the existing structure. Accurate pricing is highly dependent on careful review of all addenda and field verification of existing conditions."
