        "summary": "The extraction is now more complete, capturing key requirements from the specifications like testing and seismic engineering. The overall project risk is assessed as HIGH primarily due to the unverified structural capacity for the new RTUs, which is a critical scope gap. Other significant risks include potential for widespread deteriorated roof decking, undefined hazardous material scope, and long-lead times for HVAC equipment. The project requires a proactive contractor who will address these ambiguities through RFIs and qualify their bid accordingly."
